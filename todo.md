
[ ] It would be nice to have the chapter structure exactly resembling the diagram blocks.

[ ] It would be even more nice if there are two-way-links between diagram blocks and the corresponding chapter.

Both together might give a new approach of dealing with "level of detail".

Now i realize another point: Level of detail is actually an architectural aspect:
- One level of detail equals monolythic topology.
- Many levels of detail give a structure and address the basic system engineering principle to tackle arbitrary complexity.
